TuneDetectiveX empowers music enthusiasts to independently explore and monitor their favorite artists and their latest releases, providing a personalized experience without reliance on mainstream music streaming platforms. The app integrates with the Deezer API to fetch artist information, album releases, and allows users to save their favorite artists for easy access. However, please note that this may not be 100% reliable, as some data for certain artists may be missing from the API.

- **💾 Save Artists**: Save your favorite artists to quickly access their information and releases.
- **📥 Import Music**: Import music from your device and check for matching artists and releases.
