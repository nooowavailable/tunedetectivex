TuneDetectiveX, the follow-up of the OG TuneDetective App for Android. Use this app to get notified for new music releases of your fav. artists.

### Disclaimer on Code Generation

This app was developed primarily using AI tools such as ChatGPT, similar to the original TuneDetective project.
Most of the code was generated through iterative prompting, testing, and refinement.

After looking for an open-source app like TuneDetective that respects user privacy, I set out to create my own version. While I initially intended to code the app independently, I faced personal challenges related to substance use, which eventually resulted in a lack of oxygen and a brain injury. This injury caused cognitive impairments that made independent coding difficult, so I relied on AI assistance to complete the technical implementation.

The core concept, design, and direction of the app are entirely my own.
The project is open source and available for review.

While AI generated much of the code, all decisions regarding features, structure, and functionality were made by me.

I hope you still find the core idea valuable and don’t mind the use of AI in the development process. If it’s not your thing, that’s completely fine too — the project is open source, and you’re welcome to audit or contribute to the code yourself.



This app uses by default the Deezer API (and via in-app settings (opt-in) the iTunes API to obtain in some cases more accurate and more up-to-date music information.
